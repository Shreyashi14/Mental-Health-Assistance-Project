        "# Fine-tuning Llama2 for Mental Health Counseling\n",
        "Approximately 1 in 4 adults in the United States struggle with a diagnosable mental disorder each year per estimates from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. While there are many mental health resources and professionals available, there is a lack of on-the-spot guidance that can set individuals towards the right therapeutic direction. Thanks to advancements in artificial intelligence and large language models, we now have the tools to craft such a virtual assistant. This notebook outlines the development of a preliminary prototype: we utilize a 7 billion parameter Llama 2 model, employ quantization for memory and training efficiency, and subsequently fine-tune it using Huggingface's Amod/mental_health_counseling_conversations dataset tailored for mental health Q&A. To bring this assistant to life, an in-notebook user interface is created for interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "The trained model is accessible on Huggingface under langecod/CounselLlama7B."

It covers a wide range of mental health topics with responses crafted from certified psychologists. It's tailored for refining language models, specifically for generating cogent advice on mental health inquiries. All entries pairs are in English, and each entry is structured with a 'Context' (user's question) and a 'Response' (psychologist's answer)."

Meta's Llama 2 stands out in this regard, offering a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) that span from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. The Llama 2-Chat variant is especially tailored for dialogue applications, demonstrating superior performance over other open-source chat models in various benchmarks and human evaluations for both helpfulness and safety. This made the 7 billion parameter Llama 2-Chat model an ideal choice for our prototype. Additionally, to address memory constraints, expedite training, and ensure cost-effective operations, we employed a version of the model with 4-bit weights and activations through quantization."

        "Training a quantized, generative model shares similarities with training other LLMs, such as BERT and Big Bird, but there are crucial differences to consider:\n",
        "1.  Typically, 1-3 epochs are sufficient to fine-tune the model for specific tasks. Overtraining can lead to overfitting, where the model might restrict its responses to the training set and not fully utilize the vast knowledge from Meta's pretraining dataset.\n",
        "2.  The model requires inputs that are a concatenation of prompts, contexts, and outputs, aiming to predict the outputs based on both the prompt and the context. For Llama 2, it's essential to maintain a consistent format that aligns with Llama's original pretraining:\n",

        "{{message}} [/INST] {{answer}} </s>\n",
        "```\n",
        "3. The prompt plays a pivotal role in shaping the bot's response. A less descriptive prompt can result in inappropriate or even potentially harmful responses, especially when discussing sensitive subjects like mental health. It's crucial to draft prompts that steer the model towards producing empathetic, helpful, and non-judgmental replies. Our goal is for the model to guide users towards suitable resources and techniques rather than making diagnoses or prescriptions.\n",

        "\n",
        "A simple chatbot user interface was set up using Ipywidgets so that the user can interact with the model, ask mental health related questions, and sample the responses. In general, the responses are pretty on topic, are non-judgmental, empathize with the user, and are helpful without stating its advice as prescriptions. I've noticed that the model also tends to refer the user to real resources and websites, which is always a concern with LLM hallucinations. However, there are some major issues. For one, the sentences are generally short, simple, and may even be redundant or repetitive at times. This is to be somewhat expected, as we are using a 4 bit quantized version of the weakest model available, and upgrades should alleviate these issues. Hallucinations also occasionally occur in the responses, especially when the input is unexpected. For instance, when the input is blank, I've observed the model make out-of-pocket statements such as the model suffering through sexual harrasment and emotional abuse growing up... Future iterations should pay due diligence with prompt improvements and response parsing, in addition to leveraging a more powerful model, to help mitigate these issues."

Cognitive therapy will help you identify and change your thoughts about yourself and the world. Cognitive therapy also helps people learn how to manage stress. Cognitive therapy is a goal oriented approach to counseling. A trained therapist will help you identify goals for your treatment, which is important because goals give us motivation. If you do not have goals, it can be hard to know if we are making progress. A trained therapist will also teach you new coping skills. Coping skills are skills that we learn how to manage our thoughts and behaviors so that we can deal with the stress that we experience. If you have depression, anxiety, or stress that is interfering with your ability to function, I would strongly encourage you to speak to a licensed therapist.  "

              "<strong>Assistant:</strong> Cognitive therapy pinpoints your issues by paying attention to the way you think. The therapist will start by asking you questions to get to know you, your thoughts, your beliefs, your fears, your values, and your coping skills. You may want to say that you don't know or understand what you fear and that you're afraid of something without knowing what it is. Cognitive therapy helps you understand that there are usually negative thoughts or voices that may be causing fear or anxiety. Once you become aware of those thoughts, you can then learn to challenge the thoughts and change them if they are negative or unhelpful. Cognitive therapy has many coping skills such as mindfulness, relaxation, thought stopping, and cognitive restructuring. For example, when you notice that you're having negative thoughts, you can challenge them by asking yourself if they're really true, if you have evidence to support them, and if there is a better way to think about the situation. For example, you may think to yourself, \"I hate my job and I'm going to quit.\" That is a negative thought that has no evidence to support it and is not a good way to think about your job. In cognitive therapy, you would challenge that thought by asking yourself if there is any evidence that supports the thought that you hate your job. For example, you may find that you've worked for the same company for many years and you've always been happy with your job. If there is no evidence to support the thought that you hate your job, then you can try to reframe your thought to something more positive, such as \"I'm not happy with my job, but I have been happy with my job for a long time.\" You may also learn coping skills such as mindfulness meditation and relaxation techniques that can help you cope with your negative thoughts and feelings.

        "This notebook covered the fine-tuning of a 7 billion parameter Llama 2 model for the purpose of mental health counseling, utilizing a dataset consisting of Q&A pairs from counselchat.com. This was made possible through quantization, low rank adaptation and crafting prompts to suit the specific requirements of mental health interactions. A chatbot interface implemented via Ipywidgets also facilitated user interaction and evaluation of model responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are some areas for improvement though. The model sometimes produced brief, repetitive, or even hallucinatory responses. This can be linked to the constraints of using a 4-bit quantized, smaller version of the Llama 2 model. An upgrade can help enhance its performance. Furthermore, refining our prompt designs and enhancing response processing can enhance the model's effectiveness. As we look ahead, our goal is to enrich the dataset with varied sources, ensuring a more comprehensive response system. Although our current setup is rudimentary, envisioning a UI centered around user needs, complete with features like tailored exercises and coping strategies, can significantly uplift the user interaction and benefits."
